# 🔐 ECDSA-Wallet

A simulated Web3 wallet app that uses ECDSA cryptographic signatures for secure transactions between addresses. Built for educational and portfolio purposes using React, TailwindCSS, and a custom backend powered by Express and LowDB.

---

## 🧠 Summary

**ECDSA-Wallet** allows users to generate wallets (public/private key pairs), view balances, and send signed transactions to other wallets using elliptic curve cryptography. All data is persisted on the backend using a simple JSON-based database (`LowDB`), simulating real-world blockchain mechanics without needing an actual blockchain.

---

## 🔐 Features:

- 🔑 Generate public/private key pairs using ECDSA (secp256k1)
- 💾 Persist wallets in browser's `localStorage`
- 📥 Check balance of any address
- 🔒 Sign and verify transactions using private key (never exposed)
- ⚖️ Prevent transfers to self or with invalid signatures
- 📜 View transaction history (stored via LowDB)
- 🧹 Delete wallets and update UI in real-time
- 🎨 Stylish interface built with Tailwind CSS

npm run dev

🌐 Deployment
The project can be deployed in two parts:

Frontend on Vercel
Backend on Render

🔗 Live Frontend: https://ecdsa-wallet.vercel.app  
🔗 Backend API:   https://ecdsa-wallet-backend.onrender.com


🎓 Educational Value:

What you’ll learn:

🔐 Asymmetric cryptography using ECDSA

📩 Message signing & verification

🧭 Secure transaction flow with hash validation

💡 Designing a full-stack dApp architecture

🛠 Persisting data using LowDB as a lightweight backend

Perfect for newcomers who want to understand Web3 without diving straight into Solidity or deploying smart contracts.


🔮 Future Improvements:
🔐 Encrypt private keys in localStorage (AES)

🦊 MetaMask integration with ethers.js

📦 Migrate from LowDB to MongoDB or PostgreSQL

🧪 Add full unit & integration tests
